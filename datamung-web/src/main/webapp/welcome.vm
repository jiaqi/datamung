    <h2>What is it</h2>
    <p>
        Open source service that backs up MySQL RDS instances in form of
        S3 objects, which allows to replicate RDS across regions or AWS
        accounts. Driven by
        <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/swf">AWS Simple Workflow</a>
        , it does so by
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a snapshot of RDS instance to backup</li>
            <li>Launch a new RDS instance with snapshot</li>
            <li>
                Launch an EC2 instance that can reach new RDS instance
            </li>
            <li>
                Execute mysqldump command on EC2 instance against new
                RDS instance and save result to disk or HDFS cluster
            </li>
            <li>Upload mysqldump result to specified S3</li>
            <li>
                Terminate new RDS instance and EC2 instance
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Each step is retried upon failure.

        This website is a quick demo of DataMung. Here you may try
        backing up a MySQL RDS instance under your AWS account. If it
        does sound like a solution of your problem, why not
